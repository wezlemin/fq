# Fix "App Not Installed (– Package Conflicts)" on Android (No PC)
## Before you continue...
- Do you already have Roblox or Delta installed? Try deleting them first, then reinstall.
- Are you using the latest version of Android? If not, update it and then reinstall. You should have Android 11 or higher at a minimum.
- Are you downloading it from https://deltaexploits.gg? If not, download and install it from there.
- Did the APK download correctly? Try downloading it using another browser or a VPN.
- Have you enabled “Allow from unknown sources” for Chrome? If not, enable it and try reinstalling.
- Is Play Protect enabled in the Play Store? Try disabling it, then reinstall.
- Do you have multiple profiles or a Secure Folder on your device? Check if Roblox or Delta was installed there.
- What is your phone’s CPU architecture? (You can use CPU-Z to find out.) If it is ARM32, that might be the issue, since Delta sometimes doesn’t support ARM32.
- Have you tried clearing the cache for the package installer?
- Have you tried using a different package installer?
